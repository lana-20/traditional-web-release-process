*_Traditional_ in a sense that, comparatively, the _modern_ MicroService Architecture builds - combined with Continuous Integraton/Deployment(Delivery)/Testing tools - deploy every few seconds/minutes/hours/days. The larger the company, the faster they build. The weekly and bi-weekly Agile Sprint cycles are, nevertheless, rather common among small and medium sized companies.
